# Building a website with Node.js and Express

This repository contains the code for my course 'Building a Website with Node.js Node.js' on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-a-website-with-node-js-and-express-js-3).

The master branch contains the initial version to get started with, while the branches contain the state of the code at the beginning (e.g. 02_02**b**) and end (e.g. 02_02**e**) of a video.
